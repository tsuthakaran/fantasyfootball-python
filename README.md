The main contents are located in the python folder. 
Running the fantasyfootball.py file will allow the simulation to work. The matches are called from this file and the details are located in the match file. Likewise the other classes corrolate to the objects that they are responsible for. 
The original Java files for the previous project are in the src folder. The fantasyfootball.java files needs to be run for that to work.
The aim was to introduce myself to Python by doing one of my earlier projects that was in Java. I have been able to make several improvements to it such as the use of OOP ideas to make the code much more accessible. The code itself has been trimmed down tremendously and can hopefully be read a lot better now.
